## Ongoing development tracks

1. performance (e.g. memory use)
1. mobile (e.g. responsive UI)
1. maintenance (e.g. modularization)
1. integration (e.g. embedding, SQL Server support)
1. Form Builder modernization (e.g. drag-and-drop)

## What's in a release

For each release, in addition to bug-fixes and features, we would like to:

- book one day of work on [documentation](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues?direction=desc&labels=Doc&milestone=&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)
- pick one maintenance (build system, refactoring, …) item
- pick one performance item
- pick one mobile item if possible

The idea is, as some of those tasks are large, to do it incrementally when possible, so that some progress is made.

## Orbeon Forms 4.6

Focus:

- one performance item
    - suggested: [#1143](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1143)
- one maintenance item
    - suggested: 
- [4.6 issues](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues?direction=desc&milestone=37&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)

Dates:

- 2014-05-08: branching and big feature freeze
- 2014-06-05: tentative release date

## Orbeon Forms 4.7

Focus:

- TBD

Dates:

*Counting 1 slower month.*

- 2014-08-xx: branching and big feature freeze
- 2014-09-xx: tentative release date

## Tracks

### Performance

- memory use (see [#1606](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/1606))

### Mobile

- responsive UI

### Maintenance

Like any project, Orbeon Forms has some technical debt. It is not possible to remove all of it at once, but, like garbage collection, we would like to improve the code base incrementally. This includes:

- modularization of the code
- drop old frameworks and adopt new ones

### Integration

- embedding
- SQL Server support

### Form Builder modernization

- drag-and-drop
