# Services and actions

Orbeon Forms comes with a few powerful options to perform complex operations on or with forms. These fall into two main categories:

* _Actions:_ They run within a form while the user is working with the form.
* _Simple Processes:_ They typically run in association with a form button, such as a "Submit" button.

The following diagram illustrates how Actions and Simple Processes relate to a form:
