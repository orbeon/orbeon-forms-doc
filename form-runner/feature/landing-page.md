# Landing page

## Availability

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2022.1]

## Introduction

The Landing page is organized in cards which provides quick access to:

- Quick links, including Form Builder and the Administration page
- Your published forms
- Your in-progress Form Builder forms
- Demo forms

![The Landing page](/release-notes/images/landing.png)

Some cards directly list content, including the list of published forms and the list of in-progress Form Builder forms.

You can configure whether you want to have a particular card on the Landing page. For example, you can hide the demo forms for production deployment.

All Form Runner and Form Builder navigation bars now provide a direct link to the Landing page. This can be disabled if not desired.
