# Datasets

## Introduction

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2017.1]

A dataset is a mutable set of data, usually returned by a service and stored in the form in XML format.

A dataset is *transient* at this point:

- It is not saved alongside the data in the database.
- It is not passed when navigating between the "edit" and "view" modes.

Instead, a dataset lives as long as the user stays on the given form page.

## Creating a dataset

You create a dataset using the [Simple Actions Editor](../../form-builder/actions.md). The data returned by the service is stored into the dataset in XML format.

A dataset is identified by a name. Multiple actions calling services can store data into the same dataset. The action which last updates the dataset overwrites the entire content of the dataset. 

## Using data from the dataset

Storing data into the dataset only makes sense if you make use of that data at a later point.

You do so using the [`fr:dataset()`](/xforms/xpath/extension-form-runner.md#frdataset) function. You can use this function from  [formulas](../../form-builder/formulas.md), including validations, visibility, etc. For example: 

```xpath
fr:dataset('activity-dataset')/foo/bar
```

## Limitations

Datasets do not work in section templates yet, see [issue #3132](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/3132).
