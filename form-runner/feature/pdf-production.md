# PDF production

## Introduction

Orbeon Forms can produce PDF output in two ways:

- __Automatically__
    - The PDF is produced based on the appearance of the form in your web browser. This is similar to printing a read-only version of your form.
    - As a form author, you do not need to take any action to enable this mode.
    - For more, see [Automatic PDF](pdf-automatic.md).
- __From one or more PDF templates__
    - You upload one or more PDF files using the "Attach PDF Templates" dialog. At runtime, Form Runner fills-out Acrobat fields in the template.
    - This mode is automatically enabled for a form if a PDF template is attached.
    - For more, see [PDF Templates](pdf-templates.md).

Here are examples of an invoice PDF automatically generated by Orbeon Forms, as well as a PDF template filled by Orbeon Forms:

## Availability

- Automatic PDF generation is available in Orbeon Forms CE and PE
- PDF Templates are an [Orbeon Forms PE](https://www.orbeon.com/download) feature.

## Setup

### Using buttons

PDF files can be accessed directly from the Form Runner Summary Page and Detail Page using the `pdf` button.

Example for the Detail Page:

```xml
<property as="xs:string" name="oxf.fr.detail.buttons.acme.order">
    summary wizard-prev wizard-next pdf tiff save review
</property>
```

Example for the Summary Page:

```xml
<property as="xs:string"  name="oxf.fr.summary.buttons.acme.order">
    home review pdf tiff delete duplicate new
</property>
```

See also [Predefined buttons](/form-runner/advanced/buttons-and-processes/README.md#predefined buttons).

### Sending

You can *send* the URL of a PDF file using the `content = "pdf-url"` parameter. See [Sending a PDF URL](/form-runner/advanced/buttons-and-processes/actions-form-runner.md#sending-a-pdf-url).

### Email

You can *email* the PDF file using the following property:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:boolean"
    name="oxf.fr.email.attach-pdf.*.*"
    value="true"/>
```

See also [Email properties](../configuration/properties/form-runner.md#email-settings).

## Production of TIFF images

[SINCE Orbeon Forms 2016.1]

PDF files can be converted to TIFF images. See [TIFF Production](/form-runner/feature/tiff-production.md).

## Third-party software requirements

Orbeon Forms produces PDF files without the need for any third-party software installation.

All modern web browsers are able to read and render PDF files, which means that you don't need any third-party software at all to read PDF files either.

If you wish so, however, you can use [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-reader.html) to read PDF files. If you are on a Mac, the built-in [Preview](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/welcome/mac) app also handles PDF files very well without the need for Adobe software.

If you wish to create or update PDF files for [PDF templates](pdf-templates.md), then you need Adobe [Acrobat Pro DC](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/free-trial-download.html?promoid=TY6XKZHL) or an alternative like [PDFpenPro](https://pdfpen.com/pdfpenpro/). However, if you use [automatic PDFs](pdf-automatic.md) then you don't need PDF authoring software.
