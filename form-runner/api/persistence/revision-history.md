## API

### Request

#### Path elements

The endpoint path requires values for the following path elements:

| Path element | Description | Mandatory |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| `app`        | app name    | Yes       |
| `form`       | form name   | Yes       |
| `document`   | document id | Yes       |

These specify the specific form data document for which to retrieve the revision history.

Note that this API does not retrieve draft form data, only final form data.

#### Parameters

The following URL parameters are supported:

| Parameter     | Description                                                 | Required | Multiple | Format           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| `page-number` | the page number, starting at 1                              | No       | No       | positive integer |
| `page-size`   | the number of items per page, defaulting to 10, maximum 100 | No       | No       | positive integer |

A client can call the API using paging, to obtain smaller chunks of the revision history. A first request can, for example, use `page-number=1` and `page-size=10`. If the response indicates that there are more items, the client can then call the API again with `page-number=2` and `page-size=10`, and so on.

#### Examples

Retrieve the first page of revision history for the orbeon/bookshelf form data document with id `adcfea40124ef8e68fa81764df389d5a80b61762`:

```
/fr/service/persistence/history/orbeon/bookshelf/adcfea40124ef8e68fa81764df389d5a80b61762?
    page-number=1&
    page-size=10
```
