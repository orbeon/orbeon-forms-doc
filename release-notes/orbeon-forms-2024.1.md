# Orbeon Forms 2024.1

__Tuesday, December 31, 2024__  

Today we released Orbeon Forms 2024.1! This release is absolutely packed with new features and bug-fixes!

## Major new features

### Introduction

With Orbeon Forms 2024.1, we are introducing a number of major new features. Several of them contribute to improving usability, navigability, and visibility of forms and form data.

In addition, some features improve the deployment of Orbeon Forms, including cloud deployment, and deployment with JavaScript embedding. 

### Improved "New Form" dialog with templates

In previous versions, creating an entirely new form with Form Builder always started with a default blank template.

The "New Form" dialog now starts with a series of form templates that you can choose from. There are built-in form templates, but you can make your own form templates.

<figure>

    </picture>
    <figcaption>New Form dialog with templates</figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, providing a form application name and form name is now optional when you start. You can provide them later, after you've started working on the form. This makes getting started on a new form more straightforward. Finally, when you pick an application name and form name, Form Builder checks the in-progress and published forms for a match to tell you whether that combination is already in use.

</figure>

You can mark any form you create as a template, and that form will then show in the list of available templates.

    </picture>
    <figcaption>Marking a form as available as a template</figcaption>
</figure>

You can associate a thumbnail with each form, which will be used in the Form Builder New page as well as on the Landing page (see below). That thumbnail can be a screenshot of the form, or any other graphic you choose.

        <img src="../form-builder/images/form-settings-thumbnail.png">

### Sorting and improved searching on the Summary page

The Form Runner Summary page already allowed you to *search*, but it now allows you to *sort by metadata or field* as well.

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-runner/images/summary-sort.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Sorting by "Title" field on the Summary page</figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, search has been improved to search and sort by the following metadata information (when present):

- Created Date
- Last Modified Date
- Created by Username
- Last Modified by Username
- Workflow Stage

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-runner/images/summary-search-modified.png">

</figure>

###  Improved date format configuration

The Orbeon Forms Date control got improved in a couple of ways. Like for the [Time form control](https://www.orbeon.com/2023/01/time-form-control-improvements.html), we have made the format a configuration of the Date control. This means that you can specify the date format for each Date control individually, at the form level, or in configuration properties, as is the case for all other form control configurations in Orbeon Forms.

The format allows you to control the following:

- the order of the fields: Month first, Day first, Year first
- the separator to use
- pad the months and days with zeros or not

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-runner/component/images/xbl-date-editor-custom-cropped-small.png" style="width: 100%">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Custom date format configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

If you are configuring this at the form control or form level, you can do this in the Form Builder UI, so you donâ€™t have to figure out a textual syntax (but you still use such a syntax in Orbeon Forms configuration properties).

In addition, we have fixed other issues with the Date control, and we have brought a couple of existing configurations to the Form Builder UI:

- Use browser date picker
- First day of the week

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-runner/component/images/xbl-date-editor.png" style="width: 100%">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Browser date picker and first day of the week</figcaption>
</figure>

The following shows examples of Date and Time controls at runtime:

    </picture>
    <figcaption>Date and time controls</figcaption>
</figure>

### Sorting and searching on the Admin and Published Forms pages

The Forms/Admin and Forms/Published pages now allow you to sort as well.

        <img src="../form-runner/images/published-forms-sort.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Sorting by "Form Title" on the Admin and Published Forms pages</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also search by metadata or field.

    <figcaption>Sorting and searching by "Form Title" on the Admin and Published Forms pages</figcaption>
</figure>

### Form Density Setting

You now have a choice of several form density settings:

- __Compact:__ This is the current default with Orbeon Forms until 2023.1.
- __Comfortable:__ This is the default for forms created with Orbeon Forms 2024.1 and later.
- __Roomy:__ Choose this for even more spacing between controls.

This setting can be set globally, per app, or per form, with a setting in Form Builder as well.

<figure>

        <img src="../form-builder/images/form-settings-density.png" style="width: 100%">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Form Density Setting</figcaption>
</figure>

For more, see also the [Form Density Setting](https://www.orbeon.com/2024/11/form-density) blog post.

### Variable completion in formulas

Like in a spreadsheet, a formula can reference other form control values. Formulas now provide completion of control names: simply type the `$` character, and a completion menu appears. It shows not only the name of the field, but also its label.

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-builder/images/variable-completion-menu-open.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Variable completion in formulas</figcaption>
</figure>

For more, see also the [Variable completion in formulas](https://www.orbeon.com/2024/12/variable-completion-formulas) blog post.

### Landing page improvements

The Orbeon Forms Landing page, introduced with Orbeon Forms 2022.1, now allows you to show cards showing the latest data for specific forms that you configure. This gives you quick access to your important data.

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-runner/images/landing-form-data-card.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Landing page with cards</figcaption>
</figure>

In addition, we have split the Orbeon Demo Forms and Demo Features. These, of course, are just examples, and can easily be removed with a simple configuration for your dev, test, or production environments.

### Angular and React components for form embedding

We have added two new components for form embedding:

- __Angular component.__ For details, see [Angular component](/form-runner/link-embed/angular-component.md) blog post.
- __React component.__ For details, see [React component](/form-runner/link-embed/react-component.md) blog post.

These components allow you to embed forms in Angular or React applications. They add to our existing embedding APIs:

- [Form Runner server-side Java embedding API](/form-runner/link-embed/java-api.md)
- [Form Runner proxy portlet](/form-runner/link-embed/liferay-proxy-portlet.md)
- [Form Runner JavaScript Embedding API](/form-runner/link-embed/javascript-api.md)
- [Form Runner offline embedding API](/form-runner/link-embed/offline-embedding-api.md)

### New naming convention for the global library

Form Builder supports reusable *section templates*, which can be present in two separate *libraries*:

- A global library, usable from any form in the system.
- An application-specific library, usable from forms in the same application.

Previously, the global library was named `orbeon/library`, while an application `acme`'s library was named `acme/library`. We didn't like that the global library was named `orbeon/library`, as:

1. It wasn't clear that this was a global library rather than a library for forms in the `orbeon` application.
2. Some users who do white-labeling might not want to see the name `orbeon` appear.

With this Orbeon Forms version, we have moved the global library to an anonymous application called `_` (which stands for "global" or "placeholder" or "wildcard"), and the global library is now named `_/library`. This is not truly meant to be seen by form authors or end users, but rather it is an internal name.

For backward compatibility, the `orbeon/library` library is still available. A new global library should be created with the new name. If both libraries are present, both are shown by Form Builder.

### Support for OpenID Connect (OIDC)

We added support for [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)) as an authentication method when using the WildFly container. This is a step towards easily allowing deploying Orbeon Forms on cloud services such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services.

### Support for leases in Form Builder

Previously, a [Lease](/form-runner/feature/lease.md) was only supported for published forms. With this version, leases are supported for Form Builder itself. This allows to better control how multiple form authors can edit a form in Form Builder without conflicts.

<figure>
    <picture>
        <img src="../form-builder/images/form-builder-lease.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Message showing the user owns the lease</figcaption>
</figure>

### Keyboard shortcuts

With Orbeon Forms 2023.1.3, we had already added a number of keyboard shortcuts in Form Builder (see [the "Improved Keyboard Shortcuts" blog post](https://www.orbeon.com/2024/07/keyboard-shortcuts)).

With this release, we have added more keyboard shortcuts, including shortcuts to enter specific form controls. This can greatly accelerate how power users create forms.

For details, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](/form-builder/keyboard-shortcuts.md#inserting-form-controls).

### Page load and service performance

We have simplified our internal router. This can improve performance for page loads and service calls. This is noticeable in particular with the [Form definitions and form data Zip Export](/form-runner/feature/exporting-form-definitions-and-form-data.md), where exports can be 30% faster.

## Compatibility and upgrade notes

### Namespace attributes at the top of properties-local.xml

You need to make sure that your main Orbeon Forms configuration file, `properties-local.xml`, features `xmlns:fr` and `xmlns:xxf` attributes at the top. Your existing file might start with:

```xml
<properties
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:oxf="http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors"
>
    ... content of the configuration file here ...
```

Make sure to include the  `xmlns:fr` and `xmlns:xxf` attributes as well, for example:

```xml
<properties
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:oxf="http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors"
    xmlns:fr="http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/form-runner"
    xmlns:xxf="http://orbeon.org/oxf/xml/xforms"
>
    ... content of the configuration file here ...
```

Failing to have these configuration attributes might prevent Orbeon Forms from starting. These attributes are present on the template file, `properties-local.xml.template`, provided with Orbeon Forms.

### Disabling the embedded SQLite database

Orbeon Forms comes with an embedded SQLite database in order to show demo forms, and also to allow to quickly get started with Orbeon Forms. This maps to a provider called `sqlite`. To disable access to the embedded database after you have [set up your own relational database configuration](/form-runner/persistence/relational-db.md), make sure to also [disable the embedded SQLite database](/form-runner/persistence/relational-db.md#disabling-the-embedded-sqlite-provider).

### Excel export button on the Summary page

The default `oxf.fr.summary.buttons` configuration property now includes `excel-export-with-search` by default. This means that, by default, a user can export the Summary page content in Excel format. If you do not wish this, you can set your own `oxf.fr.summary.buttons` configuration property.

### Deprecation of catpcha tokens in configuration

Previously, the `oxf.fr.detail.captcha` or `oxf.fr.detail.captcha.component` supported tokens, including:

- `reCAPTCHA`
- `SimpleCaptcha`
- `OnPremiseCaptcha`

With this version, component names should be used instead, as follows:

- `fr:recaptcha`
- `fr:friendly-captcha`
- `fr:on-premise-captcha`

There is backward compatibility support for tokens. For details see [Captcha components](/form-runner/component/captcha.md).

### reCAPTCHA v3

Orbeon Forms now supports reCAPTCHA v3. For this reason, the configuration properties have changed. 

For details see [Captcha components](/form-runner/component/captcha.md).

### Simple data migration

The default is changed from `disabled` to `enabled` for new forms, with the following built-in property:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:string"  
    name="oxf.fr.detail.data-migration.*.*"                              
    value="{if (fr:created-with-or-newer('2024.1')) then 'enabled' else 'disabled'}"/>
```

Although we do not recommend it, you can revert to the older behavior with:

```xml
<property
    as="xs:string"  
    name="oxf.fr.detail.data-migration.*.*"                              
    value="disabled"/>
```

### Index names

We previously had a typo in the names of some indexes for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MySQL: some indices began with `orbeon_from` instead of `orbeon_form`. Although this typo doesn't cause any issues, you may want to check for it during your upgrade and rename the affected indices for consistency. We corrected this typo in the DDL we provided in November 2024, so if you created your indices before that date, you likely have this typo.

### Date formats
 
With this release, for Date controls, `the oxf.xforms.format.output.date` property is no longer used in readonly modes. Instead, the `output-format` parameter of the time field is used, which defaults to the value of the global `oxf.xforms.format.input.time` property.

See [Date](/form-runner/component/date.md) component for more information.
