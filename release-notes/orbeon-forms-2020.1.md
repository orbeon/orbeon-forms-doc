# Orbeon Forms 2020.1

__Wednesday, December 30, 2020__

Today we released Orbeon Forms 2020.1! This release introduces new features and bug-fixes.

## Notable features and enhancement

### Improvements to attachment controls

This version of Orbeon Forms introduces a new *Multiple File Attachments* control, which includes reordering attached files, a localized "Attached Files" buttons, and more. The existing *File Attachment* control also got updated and is now called *Single File Attachment*.

See the [blog post](https://blog.orbeon.com/2020/05/the-new-multiple-file-attachments.html) for details.

In addition, you can now control whether downloading an attached file is allowed or not.

See [the documentation](/form-runner/component/attachment.md) for details. 
 
### Copy and paste between forms in Form Builder

Before Orbeon Forms 2020.1, the cut/copy/paste operations were restricted to the currently running instance of Form Builder. This version of Orbeon Forms allows these operations between forms belonging to the same *user session*.

See the [blog post](https://blog.orbeon.com/2020/06/copying-and-pasting-across-forms.html) for details.
  
### JavaScript embedding

This version of Orbeon Forms introduces a JavaScript embedding API. As the name implies, this new API allows you to load an Orbeon form directly using JavaScript calls. This way of embedding forms is provided in addition to the existing Java API.

See the [blog post](https://blog.orbeon.com/2020/07/introducing-javascript-embedding-api.html) and [documentation](/form-runner/link-embed/javascript-api.md) for details.
  
### Basic Form Builder keyboard shortcuts

Form Builder now supports basic keyboard shortcuts, for the following:

- [Cut, copy, and paste](/form-builder/cut-copy-paste.md#keyboard-shortcuts)
- [Save](/form-builder/form-editor.md#keyboard-shortcuts)
- [Undo and redo](/form-builder/undo-redo.md#keyboard-shortcuts)

In the future, we plan to add more keyboard shortcuts.

### Workflow

This release takes baby steps towards supporting *workflow* features. The concept of *stage* is introduced, and supported for all relational databases. It can be controlled with the following:

- The [`set-workflow-stage` action](/form-runner/advanced/buttons-and-processes/actions-form-runner.md#set-workflow-stage) allows you to set a specific workflow stage.
- The [`fr:workflow-stage-value()`](/xforms/xpath/extension-form-runner.md#fr-workflow-stage-value) function allows you to read the current workflow stage.

In addition, you can now set an [entire form as readonly based on a formula](/form-builder/form-settings.md#formulas). This can be used in conjunction with the `fr:workflow-stage-value()` function, for example, to make the form readonly in certain conditions.

See the [blog post](https://blog.orbeon.com/2021/01/new-workflow-capabilities-in-orbeon.html) and the documentation linked in the above text for details.

### Automatic renaming of actions

When renaming an HTTP or database service, all actions using those services are automatically updated. If you attempt to delete a service, you are informed in case any actions are using that service.

This is in addition to the [existing feature](/form-builder/formulas.md#renaming-of-controls-and-formulas) whereby when a control or section or grid is renamed, dependent formulas which use the variable notation `$foo` (where `foo` is the control name) are automatically updated.

### Rich text form description

The form description now supports rich text.

See the [documentation](/form-builder/form-settings.md) for details.

### Accessibility

- Voice Over in Safari no longer reads the required "star". ([\#4628](https://github.com/orbeon/orbeon-forms/issues/4628))

- Link Buttons (buttons that show as a link), behave more like other buttons: on Safari they are reachable with the tab key, and users are able to activate them using the space key, in addition to enter, where supported by the browser.

## Compatibility notes

### With header-based authentication, provide header on every request

Starting with Orbeon Forms 2020.1, if using header-based authentication, you should provide the headers with every request made to Orbeon Forms for which you want the user to be authenticated. You can get the old behavior, by setting the `oxf.fr.authentication.header.sticky` property to `true`. For more on this, see [when to set the headers](/form-runner/access-control/users.md#when-to-set-the-headers).

### Navigation from the `view` to the `edit` page

When users load the `view` page for a form and click on the "Edit" button, to edit the data they are currently viewing, starting with Orbeon Forms 2020.1, the browser loads the `edit` page as if users were to paste the URL of the edit page in the location bar of their browser, while up to Orbeon Forms 2019.2, the data loaded by the `view` page was sent to the `edit` page. In general, this won't make a difference, but it could, if:

- Between the time a user A loads the `view` page and the time user A clicks on the "Edit" button, user B edits, changes, and saves the data. Since Orbeon Forms 2020.1, user A will be editing the new data, while up to Orbeon Forms 2019.2, user A would  have been editing outdated data.
- After a user loads the `view` page, the data changes somehow. Then the user clicks on "Edit". At this point, since Orbeon Forms 2020.1 they will see the data without the change done while viewing, since the data is reloaded from the database, while up to Orbeon Forms 2019.2 the data would include the change done on the `view` page. Changing the data on the view page is rare, and unless the data is immediately saved, this was considered to be a bad practice, and isn't supported anymore.

### xforms-deselect event

This change is due to the implementation of support for the `xf:copy` element.

The default action of the `xforms-deselect` event on a single-selection control now clears the selection control's value. This is consistent with the behavior of multiple selection controls.

XForms code which depends, upon `xforms-select`, on the presence of the older value of the selection in the control's bound node, needs to be updated. This should be a rare occurrence.
